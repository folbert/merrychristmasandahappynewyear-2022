                <h2>What is this?</h2>

                <p>The sentence above is made up of a total of {{ $sentence->get_nr_of_filled_cells() }} emojis whose type and color is randomized on every page load. Each letter is built by a grid system in HTML and CSS which, in turn, is based on text files like <a href="static-assets/grid-templates/m.txt">M</a> and <a href="static-assets/grid-templates/s.txt">S</a>.</p>

                <h2>Where is the Strava art that used to be here?</h2>
